---

## Step 1: Create the repository on GitHub

1. Go to **https://github.com/new**
2. Sign in if needed.
3. **Repository name:** `PlaywritetestSLIIT` (or create it if it doesn’t exist).
4. Choose **Public**.
5. **Do not** check “Add a README”, “Add .gitignore”, or “Choose a license”.
6. Click **Create repository**.

## Step 2: Upload the project files

1. Open your project folder in File Explorer:
   ```
   c:\Users\sachi\Downloads\Loku Brother\Loku Brother\singlish-sinhala-playwright-tests
   ```

2. **Select these to upload** (drag into GitHub or use “upload files”):
   - `.gitignore`
   - `GITHUB_SETUP.md`
   - `README.md`
   - `jsconfig.json`
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json`
   - `playwright.config.ts`
   - `src` (entire folder)
   - `test-data` (entire folder)

3. **Do NOT upload:**
   - **`node_modules`** — too large; anyone who clones the repo will run `npm install` to get it.

4. On GitHub: click **“uploading an existing file”** (or **Add file** → **Upload files**), then drag the selected items or choose them. Add a commit message (e.g. *Initial upload*) and click **Commit changes**.

## Step 3: Updating the repo later

To add or change files later: open the repo on GitHub → **Add file** → **Upload files** → choose the updated files → commit.

Done. Your project will be at **https://github.com/IT22357144/PlaywritetestSLIIT**.
